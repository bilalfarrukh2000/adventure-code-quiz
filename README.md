# adventure-code-quiz
I have built a timed coding quiz that consists of about five multiple choice questions. Powered by Javascript, CSS, and HTML, I have successfully ran this app in the browser. I have also cleaned and polished the interface in a way that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. The end result provides a full on multiple choice quiz in which a timer is counting down from 75, as well as being penalized by 10 seconds each time the user makes an incorrect answer. The quiz will also record each and every time the user makes an incorrect answer.
